# 📚 Talesmithing

**Talesmithing** is a full-stack mobile application that helps tabletop RPG players and game masters manage their fictional universes — characters, locations, items, timelines, relationships, and notes — all in one place, accessible from any device.

> 🛠️ Built entirely in **TypeScript** with **NestJS** (backend) and **Expo (React Native)** (frontend).
